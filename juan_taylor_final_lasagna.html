<h2 style="padding-left: 80px">Ingredients</h2>
<ul style="padding-left: 95px">
  <li>
	15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups
  </li>
  <li>
	1 large egg
  </li>
  <li>
	2 cups mozzarella cheese
  </li>
  <li>
	¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
  </li>
  <li>
	2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
  </li>
  <li>
	½ teaspoon salt
  </li>
  <li>
	¼ tsp pepper
  </li>
  <li>
	1 tablespoon olive oil
  </li>
  <li>
	1 yellow onion, finely diced
  </li>
  <li>
	¾ lb. ground beef
  </li>
  <li>
	¾ lb. ground Italian sausage
  </li>
  <li>
	3 cloves garlic
  </li>
  <li>
	½ cup chicken broth
  </li>
	40 oz. marinara sauce
  <li>
	  1 tablespoon tomato paste
  </li>
  <li>
	  1 teaspoon hot sauce
  </li>
  <li>
	  1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
  </li>
  <li>
	  12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage
  </li>
  <li>
	  2.5 cups mozzarella cheese
  </li>
</ul>
	
<br>
	
<h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>
	
<p class="directions">Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</p>

<p class="directions">Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="directions">
Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</p>
<p class="directions">
Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</p>

<p class="directions">Preheat oven to 375°.</p>

<p class="directions">Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles according to package instructions. Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</p>

<p class="directions">Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</p>

<p class="directions">Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.
Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</p>
<p class="directions">
Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.
Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</p>

<p class="directions">Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</p>

<p class="directions">Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.
</p>
	
<p class="directions">Bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. If desired, broil at 450° to brown the top more, watch it carefully during this time.</p>
	
<p class="directions">Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</p>
